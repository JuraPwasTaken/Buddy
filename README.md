# Buddy
Buddy is a computing companion made to make certain tasks easier.

It's coded in Python. It uses .find() to analize user input and to execute a task.

Before contributing, please follow these rules:

-If your contribution requires user input to access other parts of your code, please label the process name in capital letters before the function's execution

-ALWAYS end your contribution with correctExecution=True. This tells Buddy that it successfully ended a task and that it doesn't have to apologise for not understanding your request, even tho it executed it

-Please for the love of God don't modify the user input or tinker with other variables/lists/functions in your contribution

-Have the "process tags" (for example, .find("how" and "you")>=0:) written in lowercase letters

-comment your code, darnit!
